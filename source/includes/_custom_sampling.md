# Custom Sampling Settings

Wootric allows you to change some of the default sampling settings to suit your needs.

You may edit the sampling settings at our website by going to "Settings" and then "Customize Sampling."

## First Survey

This allows you to set the number of days after a new user signs up that
you wish to wait before he sees his first survey. By default this is set to 31 days from
created_at. Please make sure that you are sending us the users created_at date. (Format is an
integer number of days).

## Survey Throttle

This allows you to set the number of days after a user is surveyed during which they will not be surveyed again.

## Time Delay on Page

This setting delays the Wootric modal from appearing on a page by a
certain length of time from when the page loads, in seconds. The default is no delay. (Format is
an integer number of seconds).

## Registered Users % Surveyed

This allows you to set the percentage of your registered user
traffic that you wish to sample in a 3 month period. By default, this is set to 33% or a registered
user who visits your site has a 1 in 3 chance of being served the survey in a 3 month period.
Make sure that you are sending us an email address for the registered user. (Format is an
integer percentage).

## Visitor % Surveyed

This allows you to set the percentage of your visitor traffic (non
registered users) that you wish to sample in a 3 month period. By default, this is set to 1% or a
visitor to your site has a 1 in 100 chance of being served the survey in a 3 month period. This
setting is only for unknown users. (Format is an integer percentage).
