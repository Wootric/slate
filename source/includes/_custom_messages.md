# Custom Messages

Wootric allows you to specify additional custom messages.
This is done on our website in "Settings" and "Customize Survey."

**Note:**
If the custom messages are not specified, the default messages will
be presented instead. By default, we present the following messages:

* The default Wootric question:
**"How likely are you to recommend Wootric to a friend or co-worker?"**
* The default follow-up question:
**"Thank you! Care to tell us why?"**
* The default text box prompt text:
**"Help us by explaining your score."**

##Survey Language

Define the language of the message as it appears to your customers.

##Product/Company Name

Define the name of your product/company as it will appear in the survey question.

## Audience

Define a customized recommend target text that is the end part of the
question.
By default, when this property is not set, we display:
"How likely are you to recommend Wootric to a friend or co-worker?"

## Follow-Up Question

Define the question that follows a user's response. You may define a default question for all scores or a specific question for detractors, passives, and promoters.

## Text Box Prompt

Define a placeholder text that is presented to the user
after selecting the score.
