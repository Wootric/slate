# Troubleshooting

**Survey not showing up or is blank?**

Check that client ID and account token are correct. Account token should have a "NPS-xxxxxxxx" format

**I'm using `forceSurvey` but getting `User not eligible`**

Check that Wootric Mobile Switch is enabled on your [Acount Settings](https://app.wootric.com/account_settings/edit?#!/account)
